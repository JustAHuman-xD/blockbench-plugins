This plugin adds a new format that allows you to create Models and convert them into code that can be loaded using [DisplayModel-Lib](https://github.com/LordIdra/DisplayModelLib)! If you haven't already checked out DisplayModel-Lib before hand, it is highly reccomended to start there first!
## Getting Started
To use this plugin, start by creating a new **Display Model** project from the start screen, or go to **File > New > Display Model**. You can then begin creating your model! Remember that you are **limited** to **vanilla textures**, as this functions on vanilla functionality.
<br><br>
The display model consists of a series of cuboids, each cuboid is given a material, stone by default, that can be changed with a **Right-Click > Change Material**. Make sure that the name of each of the cuboids are different! The name will be turned into the id for the display model so they must be unique.

Once you are satisfied with your model you can look in the **Display Model Code** panel and click **Copy to Clipboard**! By default it will convert the model to **java code** but you can toggle **yml format** to export to yml!
